        "a": "64 bits",
        "b": "128 bits",
        "c": "192 bits",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. AES does not use a 64-bit key size.",
        "b": "Correct. 128 bits is one of the standard key sizes used in AES.",
        "c": "Correct. 192 bits is one of the standard key sizes used in AES.",
        "d": "Correct. 256 bits is one of the standard key sizes used in AES."

      "question": "In AES key expansion, what is the 'S-box' used for?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It is used to perform the initial permutation.",
        "b": "It is used to expand the key size.",
        "c": "It is used for substitution in the key schedule.",
        "d": "It is used to reduce the key size."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The S-box is not used for initial permutations in AES.",
        "b": "Incorrect. While key expansion involves the S-box, it does not itself expand the key size.",
        "c": "Correct. The S-box is used for substitution during the AES key schedule to increase cryptographic strength.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The S-box does not reduce the key size; it is part of the substitution process in key generation."
