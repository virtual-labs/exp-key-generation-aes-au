### Procedure

→ Initiate by entering a sixteen-character string. The simulator promptly translates this into its corresponding hexa-decimal form, paving the way for the AES Key generation journey.

→ Navigate with ease using the "next" and "previous" buttons provided. These will guide you through the intricate 10-round key expansion mechanism, shedding light on every minute detail.

→ Gain insights into the core aspects of AES key expansion. By clicking the designated buttons, students can access static values for the S box and round constant, granting a clear perspective into the internal machinations of the key expansion process.

→ The hexa-decimal data is rendered as a matrix, streamlining comprehension by circumventing the complexity of elongated sequences.

→ As you traverse the rounds, the simulator elucidates keys 1 to k-1 calculations with their intermediate results. Your acumen will be tested when prompted to deduce the kth round expansion key. Achieve accuracy, and the simulator unveils the subsequent phases.

→ Enhance your understanding with the Learning Component: a vivid Concept Example. This animated and simulated feature is equipped with a "Previous" button, ensuring you can review and reinforce your knowledge as many times as you wish.
