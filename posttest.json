        "c": "12",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The number of round keys is greater than 10 for AES-128.",
        "b": "Correct. For AES-128, 11 round keys are generated for the 10 rounds of encryption plus one initial round.",
        "c": "Incorrect. 12 round keys are used in AES-192, not AES-128.",
        "d": "Incorrect. 14 round keys are used in AES-256, not AES-128."

      "answers": {
        "a": "Subword rotation",

        "c": "Rcon addition",
        "d": "Initial permutation"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Subword rotation is a step in the AES key expansion process.",
        "b": "Correct. Mix Columns is a step in the AES encryption process, not key expansion.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Rcon addition is a step in the AES key expansion process.",
        "d": "Incorrect. While initial permutation is not part of key expansion, it is not specific to AES."
